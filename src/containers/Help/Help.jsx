                        <h6><b>Mercury wallet</b> is a cross-platform GUI for the Mercury protocol written in node.js using Electron.</h6>

                        <p>Mercury is an implementation of a layer-2 statechain protocol that enables off-chain transfer and settlement of Bitcoin outputs that remain under the full custody of the owner at all times, while benefitting from instant and negligible cost transactions. The ability to perform this transfer without requiring the confirmation (mining) of on-chain transactions has advantages in a variety of different applications. The Mercury Wallet operates with the Mercury protocol to enable users to keep secure custody of their Bitcoin while benefitting from fast, secure and private off-chain transactions. </p>

                        <p>The essential function of the Mercury system is that it enables ownership (and control) of a Bitcoin output (a <b>statecoin</b>) to be transferred between two parties (who don't need to trust each other) via the Mercury server without an on-chain transaction. The Mercury server only needs to be trusted to operate the protocol (and crucially not store any information about previous key shares) and then the transfer of ownership is completely secure, even if the Mercury server was to later get compromised or hacked. At any time the server can prove that they have the key share for the current owner (and only to the current owner). A statecoin owner also possesses a proof that their ownership is unique via a statechain - immutable and unique sequences of verifiable ownership transfer. The current owner signs a statechain transaction with an owner key to transfer ownership to a new owner (i.e. a new owner key). This means that any theft of a coin can be independently and conclusively proven.</p>

                        <p>A central feature of the Mercury wallet is the ability to perform atomic swaps of equal value statecoins in blinded groups facilitated by a so-called 'conductor' that cannot learn who swapped coins with who. This protocol employs a blind signature scheme to prevent any party from being able to reconstruct the coin history, providing Mercury users with a very powerful privacy tool. Due to the design of the Mercury protocol, all of these swaps occur off-chain, meaning they can happen very quickly and for zero additional transaction fees, leading to much bigger anonymity sets than is possible with a single on-chain coinjoin.</p>
